### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ash (he/him) - I'm a Cyber Security engineer by trade, but a developer in my free time.

I'm currently working on projects revolving around the content creation ecosystem, specifically targeting applications that help streamers achieve what they want.

If you want to reach me, shoot me an email or a DM on Twitter.

**Fun fact:** _Eratosthenes was an ancient-Greek polymath who was the first person to discover the Earth's circumference and axial tilt. He did so by putting up a big stick in Alexandria and hiring someone to walk 800km away to measure the angle of the Sun's rays._

If you would like to support my work, consider buying me a coffee :)
